<p>Media Piracy &amp;</p>
<p>the Precise Moment a Copy Becomes Independent</p>
<p>—Grey Areas, Morality and Hacking a Fisher Price Toy from the
70's</p>
<p>Patrick Hutchinson</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Our everyday life is a technical tour-de-force and our culture is
digital. With the computer running triumphant, acquiring, copying, and
(re-)distributing media of all filetypes has become dramatically
standardized; what was once laborious and involved great production
effort is now manageable by the amateurish, everyday consumer.</p>
<p>This high-speed era of pristine technical reproduction has been met
by the shakiest of Internet-copyright. A digital remix-culture, detached
of prohibition, has formed itself, based entirely on repurposing and
reusing present digital content. With digital reproduction as
standardized as ever, the borders between inspiration and copyright
infringement are colored in all possible shades of grey.</p>
<p>Consequently, this thesis aims to evaluate current laws of copyright
infringements in trying to establish when and how a copy may become
distinct from its original. Ideas of adaptation and modification are
established and, drawn in parallel to open-source culture, aim to
question the state of established copyright rulings online.</p>

<p>Introduction: Mood Text</p>
<p>The 2000s. «You wouldn't steal a car», it quivers in rubber-pressed
letters across the opening screen of the newly purchased DVD.</p>
<p>Even before you enter the main menu, mixed in with film previews, the
unskippable service announcement invokes, with its sinister backstreets,
leather jackets and crowbars, a dire scenery of crime and
Internet-mischief. «<em>You wouldn't steal a car, a handbag, a
television</em>»<em>,</em> it argues; likewise, you should keep your
hands away from crooked download buttons looming on the Internet.</p>
<p>The video, charmingly over the top as it may be, remains to catch
plenty of slack and harvests much amusement for its wild
analogies—rightly so, perhaps. The leap between a particularly serious
case of theft and a comparatively milder copyright infringement likely
came off a bit too ambitious for most a DVD watcher.</p>
<p>So be it. Did the broadcasting creatives of the time produce the most
compelling anti-piracy campaign possible?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Did the sequence nevertheless succeed in limiting piracy and taking a
step towards safeguarding the content of media culture?<br />
Again, not at all.</p>
<p>On the contrary, there's even indication that the clip encouraged
online piracy rather than helping in repressing it.<a href="#fn1"

<p>I. The Culture-Digital<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>At the advert's time, the triumph of the computer had plunged our
cultural world into full tour-de-force digitization. The complete
makeover of our everyday life meant unprecedented developments in
saving, multiplying, and disseminating media assets of all kinds,
virtually reduced down to the stroke of three keyboard-shortcuts. No
matter whether photo, video, or audio—the Culture-Digital is multimedia,
encoded and compressed into the <em>.</em>jpg's, <em>.</em>mp4's or
.wav's of our times. Obtaining and copying online material of any medium
has been dramatically simplified and what was once laborious and
involved great production effort is now swiftly manageable by the
amateur, everyday computer user<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In the midst of this technical reproduction spree, the question of
implementing digital copyright law becomes particularly enticing.</p>
<p>The publication of the <em>You Wouldn't Steal a Car</em> ad marked
humble beginnings of attempted copyright implementation on the web, and,
in its ridiculed reception, fittingly typifies the difficulties in
establishing stately law in a space inherently unstately.</p>
<p>It precisely marks the halfway point between today and the very
beginnings of the Internet itself; then, simply an unorganized network
of a handful of early computers, to be developed and structured upon
principles formulated by those specifically concerned with computer
networking: programmers, computer scientists, hackers, geeks, and
nerds.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Since its inception, precisely this group made sure the roots of the
Inter-network would lay in ideas of an unrestricted, anarchic space of
concentrated availability and freedom—by building these ideas into the
design of the system itself. The <em><u>Inter</u>galactic Computer
<u>Net</u>work</em><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> should be space for unrestricted
openness and collaboration. These core values were notably voiced in a
pathbreaking collection of quotes and beliefs, such as «Architecture is
Politics»<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, «Code is law»<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> and
«The net interprets censorship as damage and routs around it.»<a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> The very architecture on which the
World Wide Web was to be built was in itself designed to allow for the
free and unrestricted flow of information. There was sharing, copying,
and no one thinking about copyright regulations. Much rather, computers
were continuously developed onward in an underlying open-source<a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> approach based on the sharing and
reusing of established discoveries—early examples are the sharing of the
source code that made the Internet itself: It was simply convenient to
allow for peer review and bug fixing, seeking collaboration in times of
limited resources.</p>
<p>With the onset of the commercialization of the World Wide Web in
1995, these notions were challenged—and defended within a multitude of
appearing Manifestos, most notably John Perry Barlow's <em>Declaration
of Independence of Cyberspace</em> and Eric Hughes’s <em>Cypherpunk
Manifesto</em>, calling for independency, anti-governance<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>,
and anonymity<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>—And though each of the three have
been meddled with and pushed around throughout the last decade,
independence, anti-governance and anonymity ultimately remain. Up until
today, «a particular problem in the relationship between the state and
digital networks is the ability of the average citizen, business, or
organization operating on the Internet to evade or override most
conventional jurisdictions. Some of this is still rooted in the earlier
emphasis on the Internet as a decentralized space where authority
structures cannot be established.»<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>It seems these roots of unregulated freedom resonate especially
within the generations that don't know any handling of cultural property
outside of the existence of the Internet to begin with. The underlying
phenomena of the Internet are rubbing off on an increasingly digital
culture—the Culture-Digital.</p>
<p>The Internet, with its large-scale networking possibilities and
interconnected reference systems of hyperlinks and cross-referencing
brings with it a redistribution culture of sharing, retweeting, and
reblogging. Social media platforms (such as Twitter, and the
image/video-based Tik-Tok in particular) make the reposting and
reediting of existing material a core mechanism deeply anchored in the
very framework of the platform. Through the reinterpretation of a
previous post, trends are created, images multiply and develop new
niches.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> The Culture-Digital is one of
remixing<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>—Oftentimes, one of remixing in
complete disregard for what may be copyrighted and what may be not. In
consequence, «a large part of everyday remix practices is moving in
direct contradiction to existing legal frameworks.» Images and videos on
film and culture practically become public domain<a href="#fn16"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>,
are edited, adapted, and forwarded.</p>
<p>The origin of the post, and so the question of the author, recedes
into the background here; Resulting in «most users themselves having no
interest in being considered as authors for their own works».<a
href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Hence, new attempts to restriction are often rigorously dismissed
and, if at all, only bumpily established. In the recent past, copyright
regulations on the Internet have, in the first place, been met with
great headaches.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>II. Copyright Legalities</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overview</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is important to note here that each country establishes its own
copyright regulations - both within national borders as well as within
the Internet as well.</p>
<p>This text will refer to German law, unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p>Jurists commonly distinguish between three offences in matters of
copyright infringement. These include the commonly known acts of
counterfeiting, plagiarizing<em>,</em> and bootlegging. Product piracy
is a collective term that may refer to any of these offences.</p>
<p>Differentiating between these three terminologies can be delicate,
though generally agreed upon definitions go as follows: While
counterfeits are deceptive forgeries, often of inferior quality, and
plagiarisms refer to copies passed off as one's own creation, bootlegs
are rather an unlawfully made or distributed copy of copyrighted
material. Whereas an art forger copies a painting and makes it appear to
be created by the original artist, the plagiarist passes off the copy as
his own work.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>The bootlegger here takes a more distanced position to the work. They
rarely republish an item for personal acknowledgement and rather set
themselves the goal of redistributing the work to a (local)
community.</p>
<p>Notably though, German copyright law does not include a so-called
'legal definition' for these terms. They are rather colloquial,
popular-juristic umbrella terms for verbs brought into association by
the German dictionary such as '(to) forge, imitate, copy, borrow, adopt,
fake and mimic'.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> There are no divisive lines between
the acts and rather serve as self-made categorizations to help
navigating scenarios.</p>
<p>When examining concrete legal guidelines for determining acts of
'copyright infringement', things get cloudier. Per definition, a work is
uncopyrightable (and therefore always free to copy) if it is not
qualifiable as an 'intellectual creation', therefore being banal and
lacking the individuality required for copyright protection (§ 2 II
UrhG)<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This means, concretely, that a subsequent author may not be
prohibited from using commonplace words 'and', 'the', 'a', or even the
letter 'm' or 'n'. What is essential is that the reference in question
possesses enough 'distinctiveness' to be considered creative. Though—how
many letters does it take to formulate something original?<a
href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>A concrete formulation for the line between a banal creation and a
work possessive of 'intellectual creation' does not exist; Ergo,
copyright infringement, in its various forms of severity, does not
necessarily violate applicable law and is much rather considered a grey
area. Black and white 'yesses' and 'noes' are simply nonexistent here.
The definitions for the terms, as well as judging the severity of
infringement, will always be down to the evaluation of a judge and their
interpretation in deciding the fate of a design piece.<a href="#fn23"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Exceptions in Internet «New Land»</p>
<p>Evidently, even outside the Internet, copyright regulations,
maintained for centuries, carefully ordered, and extensively formulated,
continue to spark debate. These already shaky copyright laws of the
offline world seep into the Internet and flow from the interpretable to
the porous—As of yet, the Culture-Digital is being paired up and thrown
together with copyright legislature dating back to times of Goethe and
Beethoven.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The German law has sought to create clarity in dealing with fair use
in the so-called «new land»<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> <a href="#fn26"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>
that is the Internet in the same way it hopes to create clarity
elsewhere, too: with a bounty of more and again more paragraphs and
reformulations and legislations and a mass of bureaucratic acts.</p>
<p>The recent <em>Act to adapt copyright law to the requirements of the
digital single market</em> outlines new dos and don'ts in 171 pages of
finest legal prose: 15 seconds are allowed, 160 characters and 125
kilobytes—except <em>this</em>, and only if <em>that</em>.<a
href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Oh, Germany, you bulging bulwark of
exceptions and small print, neatly sorted and aligned—A shame, though,
that hardly any of the users on the web seem to be taking any of it
seriously - let alone seriously violating anything at all?</p>
<p>In the first place, national copyright laws in the 'real world' have
little effect in the borderless Internet and often slip off of a lack of
international consensus. «A big question is always how the various
national laws [on the Internet] are compatible with each other. What
rights apply if the server is in country A, the user is in country B and
the programmer is in country C? There are no rules there.»<a
href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>This bundled unclarity, in harmony with an unprecedented ease of
(re)production, likewise has an effect on the investigations, or rather
the non-investigations, of rule-breakers. «Technological development has
removed many barriers to the dissemination of cultural goods, so that
any computer owner can now easily create things that, in the past, would
have been possible only with significant investment. This impacts
enforcement of law, as prohibition online is handled completely
differently from that of traditional private use in the offline
world.»<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>For even when there is a clear rule-breaking, prosecution is often
too cumbersome and abundantly inefficient for prosecutors; rules and
laws are only as good as their implementation, and it seems no one
really enjoys indulging in the nitty-gritty of tedious prosecution
processes<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>—for acts that are committed
millions of times a day anyhow.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>An egalization of copyright values has taken on a life of its own on
the Internet, allowed to roam free.</p>
<p>Internet users form resistance to restrictions within the virtual
space by exerting a form of collective casualness in breaking copyright
rules, as if they were not there in the first place. «Classic copyright
law and its comprehensive protective rights are based on the fiction of
an originless creation. Creators have always stood on the shoulders of
giants. But as long as borrowed ideas were only implied, ambiguous, and
reformed in works, this fiction of an originless creation could be
maintained.»<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Not so with the wave of remixing and reappropriating the Internet is
confronting us with—the illusion has broken.</p>
<p>«The definition of the computer was that of a machine, which can
imitate all other machines. That definition should remove all
definitions of copyright and intellectual property».<a href="#fn33"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>
Or, more bluntly: «You'd have to live behind the moon to avoid any
inspiration by others.»<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>And so, an enormous breadth of anti-copyrighters, willful or
unwilful, persists firmly in place; The Internet archives, public domain
distributors and obscure torrenting platforms in fully stacked online
piracy portals, representatives of anticapitalistic access to the
content of the Internet, appearing in all possible legal and
not-so-legal shades of gray. They remain intact as remnants of the
Internet’s early days, embraced by its presentday community with open
arms. The online pirate's role does not correspond to the dirty
reputation of a rogue that once preceded them anymore. Rather, they are
the everyday consumer.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>III. Artistic Thoughts on Plagiarism and Reproduction</p>
<p>The Bootleg</p>
<p>Enough already, with legalities.</p>
<p>Judging the blurriness of legal terminology, this chapter will rather
focus on users who have made themselves comfortable within the very grey
area of copyright legislation itself—The Culture-Digital, the remixers,
the crackers<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>, rippers<sup>12</sup>,
hackers<sup>13</sup>, counterfeiters, Yankee Thrifters<sup>14</sup>,
bootleggers, modders<sup>15</sup>, pirates and copy-artists of the
times. Truly, when maneuvering the nitty grittys of law, action is often
more determinative that fine print.</p>
<p>Once a product is made public, its original, carefully curated design
is at the mercy of whomever may get their hands on it.</p>
<p>An original copy is not perfectly formed for everyone—in fact, it is
perfectly formed for a vast minority of the consumer market, and the
fact it is perfectly formed for that vast minority is because that vast
minority does not consider the design of the non-perfectly formed
object—if even anyone. It is supposedly perfectly formed for those
deemed a 'target audience': With this notion comes bias. Perhaps
<em>mechanically</em> perfectly produced, it is not
<em>functionally</em> perfect for the consumer.</p>
<p>When the original good, in its needed shape, size and functionality,
does not exist, own technical ability is required to shape what
<em>does</em> exist into something fitting your needs.<a href="#fn37"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>What the Hacker aims to achieve is to adapt the premade item,
available in countless iterations, identically perfect, to his own needs
and likings. They do not abide to sheepish acceptance. Though the
prevalent motif of the hacker has come to be associated with green text
and monospace, it rather stems from the hijacking of everyday objects,
hardware; most prevalently introduced by Nicolas Collins' <em>The Art of
Hardware Hacking</em><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>. Items are taken out of their
current functionality, broken open and analyzed for possible synthesis
with work of their own. Thus, the hacker aims to introduce his own
character and thinking into an innate object and adapt it to serve his
own purposes.</p>
<p>Through bootlegging, the consumer outside of the target audience does
not settle for the initially given and mass-produced shape of the item
but cuts away what they do not need and add on top what is necessary to
get their job done. Quick and dirty solutions do the trick to
reappropriate an object to serve its new purpose. The bootleg is a hack,
a quick solution to a complex problem. The hacker takes building block
that already exist and plugs them into each other. <a href="#fn39"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>
The result is an item akin to bricolage<a href="#fn40"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>,
not quite the original, not quite something new—a hybrid.</p>
<p>This individualized level of functionality does not exist in a world
of copyrighting and nitpicking over when an item is distinct enough from
a counterpart: Breathing space for adaptation goes out the window.</p>
<p>What is perfect for some can hardly be perfect for millions of others
also. Sometimes, what is perfect is a copy with a single modification.
Sometimes, a handful of modifications, and sometimes, half of the
original is ripped away and screwed on top of something else.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this modification occurs in magnificent technical prowess
and attention to detail, most of the times in a makeshift, DIY fashion,
starkly contrasting the original design. Gaps in initial
conceptualization are plugged with tape and plywood.</p>
<p>These processes leave traces on the original objects, so called
'scars of labor'<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>, evidence of consumption and
interference. They are craft fixes, «the glue drips, screw holes, cum
stains and fingerprints»<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> left on an immaculate
original; Proof that the original object has been taken and used. Like a
messily written name labelling a mass-produced item as one’s own, a
sense of identity and individuality is added to the object.</p>
<p>What is now present is a scratched-up version of a high-definition
first, an «illicit fifth-generation bastard of an original»<a
href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a>. Thus, the aesthetic
reappropriation of the asset directly mimics the inherently
counter-capitalist act of stealing it in the first place.<a href="#fn44"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>The bootlegger hacks into an object which is not meant to be opened.
It's an answer to throw away culture. Lack of repairability, planned
obsolescence. The bootleg does not try to hide what it is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Original</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Created around an original during production and retail is a mystical
aura, proving the items legitimacy: It relies on the idea of a perfect,
intentional, and curated state. The item carries an identity with it,
thought out by the brand that published it, carefully constructed and
maintained, apparent in its cleanest, purest form in the shelved item.
Brands rely on this idea of the original massively. It is what justifies
the power and authority over the counterfeit or any successors and gives
legitimacy to the idea of copyright in the first place.<a href="#fn45"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>It is this aura<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>, broken apart and overwritten, that
gives the bootleg, the altered version, its power. In the collection of
one-and-only originals, the slightest inconsistency stands out.<a
href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> The result is a molded-out canvas
of mechanical ex-perfection, taped over, scribbled onto, cut apart and
reglued together. <u>It adheres precisely to the needs of a one and
functions to their needs</u>.</p>
<p>Digital Bootlegging</p>
<p>Bootlegging quickly grew beyond the act of a single individual,
tinkering away, to a widespread network of the digital world. In the
digital space, the bootleg is socialized. It no longer functions
specifically for one or the other: Instead, it passes through networks
and groups as filetypes, iterating in different versions, cached by one
and processed by another. What establishes itself online is a sort of
non-space underground distribution network of those to whom the
circumstances of the original do not abide. They link together, edit to
their needs and likings, sharing among others in similar situations.</p>
<p>The functionality of torrenting methods used on virtually all
pirating networks—the <em>libgens</em>, <em>z-libraries,
thepiratebays</em> and <em>ubuwebs</em>—visualise this. Rather than
downloading files from a central server, users link together: When one
downloads a file, they get connected to many others who have done so
before them, each providing a small piece of the requested file. Once
all parts are collected, the data is pieced together on the obtainer's
computer—and the downloader ideally becomes a distributor themselves.<a
href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> <a href="#fn49"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>

class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Though inherently physical, the scars of labor reappear here again—In
the form of smearing data compression in the digital.</p>
<p>With each new copy, and redownload, and passing on, there is the
potential for a small change to be saved into the file: Be it the
reduction of video quality, as it becomes compressed and recompressed in
many up-and re-downloads, or a streaming-host who cuts their username in
front of an intercepted movie.</p>
<p>These little quirks are glitches, uncharacteristic of the mechanical
perfection are maintained in ever new split-offs of the original
file.</p>
<p>Similar to its physical counterpart, the digital bootleg becomes
independent from its high-quality counterpiece. It is adapted and, as it
is hacked, is torn apart and arranged back together elsewhere, by a
different user, all leaving their marks of use behind as the original
becomes overwritten (and overwritten and overwritten).</p>
<p>II.2. Internet Non-Law</p>
<p>Paradoxically, those underground networks and string-pullers of the
piracy portals are equally helping their opponents, the copyright
representatives, with every act of disobedience. With their creative new
solutions to find loopholes and undermine the system to keep theirs
running, they simultaneously reveal the weak spots of legislature. The
pirate exposes ways to circumvent the current regulations, allowing them
to be identified and closed by the regulators—only for a new loophole to
be found.</p>
<p>The pirate's activities thus have a direct impact on making the
copyright legislation more compact and more robust against future
attacks of their own: «The hacker becomes a helper of that knowledge
regime whose challenger they saw themself as. They oscillate between
subversion and stabilization.»<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p>But the resulting endless loop of judicial executions is tedious and
sluggish, and so it remains a game of cat and mouse in which slow
government processes are always two steps too late against the rapid
technical adaptations of their opponents.<a href="#fn53"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>
It is for this reason that many believe copyright laws are simply not
equipped to get a lock on the digital space and «Internet pirates will
always win.»<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>With the legal body of legislation failing to get a clear grip on
fair use online, the responsibility of a verdict becomes much more
dependent upon on which platform the infringement takes place and who is
affected<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>. Oftentimes, especially in artistic
cases, the users themselves become the judges of a self-governing
body.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> They call out blatant stealing and
confront plagiarists<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"

should be theirs.</p>
<p>IV. A Break: Thoughts on Labelling your Belongings</p>
<p>In the context of what has been stated before.</p>
<p>Reappropriation begins with the first step of customization:
Labelling. There is beauty in the object with a handwritten name.</p>
<p>A handwritten name is a successful first step in customizing an
item.</p>
<p>There is equal beauty in the date of acquisition.</p>
<p>Permanency is encouraged.</p>
<p>IV.2 Fixing, Hacking and Maintaining a 70's Fisher Price Toy: An
Allegory to Open-Source</p>
<p>Thoughts on Fixing and Re-fixing</p>
<p>What comes with fixing is care. Rather than throwing away an item
that has served its purpose, one figures out its exact functionality,
figures out the system it is built on, its uses, its components, and
begins curating materials to compile and merge with the original.</p>
<p>Within this mentality, things can further be adapted to one’s liking
and specific needs, filled with personality. Its functionality is
understood and can be further maintained.</p>
<p>Hacking Everyday Life</p>
<p>A particular item that I have come across, with which I am attempting
to exemplify this process, is the <em>Movie Viewer</em> produced by
Fisher Price first in the 1970's and up until today. It is a radar-gun
like object, loaded with visuals in the form of super 8 film. The user
peeks into the hollow body of the toy through a viewfinder, right onto a
strip of super 8 film, advanced by rotating a wheel on the viewer’s
side. Frame by frame, a 40 second loop of Disney footage is played
analogly right in your hands.</p>
<p><img src="media/image1.jpg" style="width:3.77982in;height:2.52225in"
alt="A picture containing person, indoor Description automatically generated" /></p>
<p>Fisher Price Movie Viewer Advertisement, 1973.</p>
<p>At some point, intrigued engineers figured out how to pry the toy
open carefully, replacing the default film with their own super 8
strips, then putting it back together again. Individuals could now flip
through their personally recorded footage, having individualized the
toy<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a>.</p>
<p>A sweet activity before Fisher Price discontinued the original and
reissued an updated version years later, switching from accessible super
8 film to a custom format. With this switch the gear advancing the film
inside the toy did not match up with the holes in publicly available
film anymore, rendering the movie viewer worthless for
customization.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, within this working methodology, I see a thorough
connection to valuable approaches of customizing present today. What had
started as an activity of taking advantage of the functionalities of a
preexisting item, now developed further into the space of coding.
Reusing previously established, functional code as a vessel for personal
projects is common practice; Almost all computer programs contain many
ideas borrowed from elsewhere. Many also contain short sections of
actual code copied and pasted—but for anyone to file a claim of
plagiarism for reuse of code is practically unthinkable.</p>
<p>I believe this approach can likewise be useful in determining an act
of unethical copyright infringement outside of the digital. Basis for
this lies on the fundamental practice of integrating the code into a
system of one's own. Value stems from adapting the underlying system to
one’s own needs and personal liking, changing what is necessary.</p>
<p>Within coding and especially the open-source movement, there is a
group of fixers, maintainers, and hackers that share the same values of
adaptation and customization to established systems, stripped of all of
their analogue qualities and passed on to the digital space.</p>
<p>In open-source culture, these readaptations, overwritings and edits
are in itself engrained in the functionality of the object, or much
rather, the creation of it: the tool, the software. There is no original
copy. Even if there were, no one would care. Programs are fully intended
to be broken open, picked apart and edited to the liking of the
individual that downloaded it to their computer. In total, an amass of
slightly different copies of a program, perfectly in sync to the needs
of each a one. What becomes much more decisive for differentiating
between blatant plagiarism and functional copying is not the visual
output, but the introduction and compilation of personal character.</p>
<p>Reenter the movie viewer. Up until today, few people remain that
scour the Internet for 1973 originals—they are sparse, crumbly and jam
easily. In a quest this thesis has brought me upon, I aim fix the second
version movie viewer and supply to necessary parts to my and the other
movie viewer comrades' needs.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>It seems incredibly fitting that the answer to the problem of the
unfitting gear itself may come from the open-source community. The idea
is to digitally recreate and mechanically reproduce the first-generation
gear through a 3D printer, bringing it back to life. In doing so, the
non-fitting gear of the second edition can be replaced, and the
customized movie viewer lives on.</p>
<p>Reframing Internet Copyright</p>
<p>It has been established that, no matter if functional execution or
artistic practice, ideas live on in further works, sometimes visible,
sometimes hidden behind reappropriation and a fresh coat of paint,
sometimes as a mere inspiration. The lines between copy and original are
not black and white, but blurry greys, differing in intensities of
modification and originality. In an increasingly digital world, remixing
and readaptation has become a social phenomenon, causing existing
regulations to crumble and be naturally disregarded: especially among
younger generations.</p>
<p>In a <em>Plea for a New Term of the Original</em>, Dirk von Gehlen
proposes a solution to the situation—Instead of maintaining the current
pseudo-black-and-white legislature, he suggests creating a scale that
allows for more gradual attribution of originality: distinguishing
between 'highly original' and 'lesser original' works. Here, clear
distinctions would not be needed anymore. A space for leeway, a
transparent communication of influence and homage could be laid out,
evading the constant question of rule breaking—kissing the idea of
'Yes!' and 'No!' and the 'masterful artistic creation' and the idea of
originality entirely goodbye.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>«The idea of originality only exists because people [in law] decide
whom possesses it. Originality is only created in the eye of the
beholder. This legitimization is just as arbitrary as the rulings of
copyright infringement themselves.»<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>The question of originality, here, would rather become one of flowing
transition, transparently communicating the level of influence.</p>
<p>Especially in dealing with generations that have been socialized on
the Internet and have built their network culture on the basic methods
of sharing and remixing, there must be adjustments. «A free society must
provide its members with opportunities for sharing and participation—and
that includes copying (and not only in the digital space). We would do
better if we were to establish a system in which one would openly draw
from the ideas of others, creating and copying references<a href="#fn62"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>»
instead of tiptoeing around legal sponginess. «Maybe that's where
originality emerges; <em>within the variation of one's own copy»</em><a
href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Instead of clear distinctions, Gehlen borrows and idea from Anaïs
Hostettler, supposing a line of thinking closer to the idea of
'Versions', akin to those derived out of software development in the
digital space und reminiscent of approaches in open-source culture. The
act of copying, rather than being an inspiring act of reproduction, is
pushed into an in itself inherently creative act of questioning existing
material and refunctioning it. With proper copying comes critical
reflection, questions of self-reliance and functionality, durability,
communication, and expression of thought.</p>
<p>Whether the exact moment of when a copy becomes independent can be
found, who knows. Whether it matters, who cares. It seems many a problem
of splitting hairs between blacks and whites could be evaded in a full
embrace of grey.</p>

<p>Glossary</p>
<p>Bricolage</p>
<p>is the art of combining preexisting, available items to create a new
object with new functionality. It may occur as a form of high art
sculpting but may equally be a DIY approach to repairing und upgrading
personal belongings. To some, the line is thin.</p>
<p>Cracking</p>
<p>Software cracking (known as 'breaking' mostly in the 1980s) is the
modification of software to remove or disable features which are
considered undesirable by the person cracking the software (software
cracker), especially copy protection features.</p>
<p>Culture-Digital</p>
<p>The Culture-Digital is the increasing part of our society that has
adapted to the technical innovation of modern time. It includes the
generations living into (and particularly the generation being born
post-) technical revolution: Those embracing and baring witness to the
digitization of our everyday lives.</p>
<p>Hacking</p>
<p>describes the muddling into a closed system, oftentimes to alter its
functionality. Though it is today considered a predominantly digital
act, early hacks were much more analogue: After the actual act of
hacking into something, parts of a system are taken and combined with
others, replugging and merging.</p>
<p>Modding</p>
<p>Modders make themselves comfortable in the source code and hardware
of a product and begin to tinker and add to it themselves. Short for
modifying, they rewrite, build upon, and add additional features that
attach to the original. Mods are add-ons and extensions for your
browser, new fan made levels to games, or a new design for your mobile
phone.</p>
<p>Open-Source</p>
<p>Software for which the original source code is made freely available
and may be redistributed and modified. Copyright limitations are almost
entirely waived, often replaced by a request for crediting. Open-Source
software is commonly developed in a collaborative public manner.</p>
<p>Public Domain</p>
<p>Content that is part of the public domain is not covered by any
copyright prohibitions and is therefore freely accessible and eligible
for reuse. Content may be part of the public domain due to ineligibility
of copyright coverage or enter it 70 years after the passing of the
originator.</p>
<p>Remixing</p>
<p>Remixing is the act of reappropriating crossing and blending digital
media—mostly image and video. It is slightly altered, commented, often
simply overwritten, to give the previous version a new, twisted context
and meaning.</p>
<p>Ripping</p>
<p>Ripping, generally, is the process of copying audio or video content
from a compact disc, DVD, or streaming media onto a computer hard drive.
Originally, media—sometimes only the music, for instance—would be
'ripped' out of its original medium and, from then on, may be edited,
backed up or republished elsewhere.</p>
<p>Yankee Thrift</p>
<p>refers to the remodelling and reappropriating of furniture, most
popularly in New York City. It is inventive improvisation, adaptation
and overcoming of shortages of materials. It is cocky, can-do
determination. Oftentimes, Apartments were too small to house
storebought furniture, so modification is necessary.</p>

mediums more akin to re-transformable jokes, communication devices based

becomes completely irrelevant. Much rather, the timely reappropriation

broadcast its website in numerous countries in a months-long lawsuit

<li id="fn55"><p>YouTube was confronted early on with the problem of
checking intangible amounts of online material for copyright
infringements due to increasing popularity among advertising partners.
As a solution, they developed the content scanning algorithm
<em>Copy-ID</em>, which scans over 500 minutes of video every
second.</p>
<p>The algorithm was quickly optimized with the rapid closure of many
loopholes that were uncovered, and illegitimate claims continue to
generate much discussion today. A flagged video results in a direct loss
of income from the creator, oftentimes appeals are burdensome. YouTube
has accepted the categorical loss of income from many of its users to
keep advertisers happy.</p>
