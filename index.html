    <!--
    <p>Internet Piracy is in full force. Never have there been so many bootlegged versions of cultural assets being created, copied and passed around as nowadays.
        They persist since a sweeping onset of digitization began reshaping our everyday culture, "removing many of the barriers to the distribution of cultural goods". Acquiring, copying, and (re-)distributing media of all filetypes has been dramatically simplified with the widespread availability of the computer, and what was once laborious and involved great production effort is now possible in just a few clicks.
        This high-speed development has been met by the shakiest of internet-copyright law as national regulations of the real world fell apart in a borderless Internet. Solutions remain far from being found.
        And so, the enormous breadth of fully stacked piracy portals online persists firmly in place; The Internet archives, public domain distributors and obscure torrenting platforms, representatives of free access to the content of the Internet, appearing in all possible legal and not-so-legal shades of gray.
        This normalization of piracy also has an impact on consumers: the online pirate's role does not correspond to the dirty reputation of a rogue that once preceded them anymore. Rather, they are the everyday consumer.

        <br><br>
        On the opposite side of this development stand the tops of the media-distribution pyramid, pleading for compliance of fair use.
        Since the very outset, they have been trying to defend themselves against the large-scale normalization of online piracy; court case after court case trickles down, but progress is minimal, if there is any progress at all. So, the questions arise as to why the phenomenon of online piracy is so incredibly persistent, why bans fail to impress it; and whether large corporations are even pursuing the right strategy in trying to ban it.
