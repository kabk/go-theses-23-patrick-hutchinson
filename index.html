                Bricolage is the art of combining preexisting, available items to create a new
                object with new functionality. It may occur as a form of high art
                sculpting but may equally be a DIY approach to repairing und upgrading
                personal belongings. To some, the line is thin.

                post-) the technical innovations of modern times: Those embracing and baring witness to the

            <div class="panel">
                A counterfeit is a deceptive copy of an original, often carefully examined and meticulously copied.

                Hacking describes the breaking into a closed system, oftentimes to alter its
                functionality. The functionality of the hacked system is analyzed and parts of a system are taken and combined with
                others, replugging and merging. Though it is today considered a predominantly digital
                act of hacking websites and servers to access date, early hacks were much more analogue, involving toy cars and physical phone lines.

                of a product and begin to tinker and add to it themselves. Short for
                modifying, they rewrite, build upon, and add additional features that
                attach to the original. Mods are add-ons and extensions for your
                browser, new fan made levels to games, or a new design for your mobile

                Originally, media—sometimes only the music, for instance—would be
                'ripped' out of its original medium and, from then on, may be edited,
                backed up or republished elsewhere.

                A torrented file is not, as per usual, downloaded from a centralised source. Rather, small packets of the full file are automatically gathered from users who have downloaded it previously, with all parts being reassembled on the requestants computer upon completion. Ideally, the obtainer of the new file now becomes a distributer themselves. This technology allows users to circumvent regulated downloading platforms and makes the downloading of files communal and private.

                determination. Oftentimes, Apartments were too small to house

            <p style="text-indent: 0px">The 2000s. «You wouldn't steal a car», it quivers in rubber-pressed
                letters across the opening screen of the newly purchased DVD.</p>
            <p>Even before you enter the main menu, mixed in with film previews, the
                unskippable service announcement invokes, with its sinister backstreets,
                leather jackets and crowbars, a dire scenery of crime and
                Internet-mischief. «<em>You wouldn't steal a car, a handbag, a
                    television</em>»<em>,</em> it argues; likewise, you should keep your
                hands away from crooked download buttons looming on the Internet.</p>
            <p>The video, charmingly over the top as it may be, remains to catch
                plenty of slack and harvests much amusement for its wild
                analogies—rightly so, perhaps. The leap between a particularly serious
                case of theft and a comparatively milder copyright infringement likely
                came off a bit too ambitious for most a DVD watcher.</p>
            <p>So be it. Did the broadcasting creatives of the time produce the most

            <span class="chapterHeadline culturedigital">!Introduction: The <span class="definitionWord">Culture-Digital</span></span><br><br>
            <p style="text-indent: 0px">At the advert's time, the triumph of the computer had plunged our
                cultural world into full tour-de-force digitization. The complete
                makeover of our everyday life meant unprecedented developments in
                saving, multiplying, and disseminating media assets of all kinds,
                virtually reduced down to the stroke of three keyboard-shortcuts. No
                matter whether photo, video, or audio—the Culture-Digital is multimedia,
                encoded and compressed into the <em>.</em>jpg's, <em>.</em>mp4's or
                .wav's of our times. Obtaining and copying online material of any medium
                has been dramatically simplified and what was once laborious and
                involved great production effort is now swiftly manageable by the
                amateur, everyday computer user.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-marker fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup> More Info</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 2</sup></a></p>
            <p>In the midst of this technical reproduction spree, the question of
                implementing digital copyright law becomes particularly enticing.</p>
            <p>The publication of the <em>You Wouldn't Steal a Car</em> ad marked
                humble beginnings of attempted copyright implementation on the web, and,
                in its ridiculed reception, fittingly typifies the difficulties in
                establishing stately law in a space inherently unstately.</p>
            <p>It precisely marks the halfway point between today and the very
                beginnings of the Internet itself; then, simply an unorganized network
                of a handful of early computers, to be developed and structured upon
                principles formulated by those specifically concerned with computer
                networking: programmers, computer scientists, hackers, geeks, and
                nerds.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 3</sup></a></p>
            <p>Since its inception, precisely this group made sure the roots of the
                Inter-network would lay in ideas of an unrestricted, anarchic space of
                concentrated availability and freedom—by building these ideas into the
                design of the system itself. The <em><u>Inter</u>galactic Computer
                    <u>Net</u>work</em><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 4</sup></a> should be space for unrestricted
                openness and collaboration. These core values were notably voiced in a
                pathbreaking collection of quotes and beliefs, such as «Architecture is
                Politics»<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 5</sup></a>, «Code is law»<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 6</sup></a> and
                «The net interprets censorship as damage and routs around it.»<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 7</sup></a> The very architecture on which the
                World Wide Web was to be built was in itself designed to allow for the
                free and unrestricted flow of information. There was sharing, copying,
                and no one thinking about copyright regulations. Much rather, computers
                were continuously developed onward in an underlying open-source<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 8</sup></a> approach based on the sharing and
                reusing of established discoveries—early examples are the sharing of the
                source code that made the Internet itself: It was simply convenient to
                allow for peer review and bug fixing, seeking collaboration in times of
                limited resources.</p>
            <p>With the onset of the commercialization of the World Wide Web in
                1995, these notions were challenged—and defended within a multitude of
                appearing Manifestos, most notably John Perry Barlow's <em>Declaration
                    of Independence of Cyberspace</em> and Eric Hughes’s <em>Cypherpunk
                    Manifesto</em>, calling for independency, anti-governance<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 9</sup></a>,
                and anonymity<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 10</sup></a>—And though each of the three have
                been meddled with and pushed around throughout the last decade,
                independence, anti-governance and anonymity ultimately remain. Up until
                today, «a particular problem in the relationship between the state and
                digital networks is the ability of the average citizen, business, or
                organization operating on the Internet to evade or override most
                conventional jurisdictions. Some of this is still rooted in the earlier
                emphasis on the Internet as a decentralized space where authority
                structures cannot be established.»<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 11</sup></a></p>
            <p>It seems these roots of unregulated freedom resonate especially
                within the generations that don't know any handling of cultural property
                outside of the existence of the Internet to begin with. The underlying
                phenomena of the Internet are rubbing off on an increasingly digital
                culture—the Culture-Digital.</p>
            <p>The Internet, with its large-scale networking possibilities and
                interconnected reference systems of hyperlinks and cross-referencing
                brings with it a redistribution culture of sharing, retweeting, and
                reblogging. Social media platforms (such as Twitter, and the
                image/video-based Tik-Tok in particular) make the reposting and
                reediting of existing material a core mechanism deeply anchored in the
                very framework of the platform. Through the reinterpretation of a
                previous post, trends are created, images multiply and develop new
                niches.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-marker fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup> More Info</sup></a> The Culture-Digital is one of
                <span class="definitionWord">Remixing</span>—Oftentimes, one of remixing in
                complete disregard for what may be copyrighted and what may be not. In
                consequence, «a large part of everyday remix practices is moving in
                direct contradiction to existing legal frameworks.» Images and videos on
                film and culture practically become <span class="definitionWord">Public Domain</span>,
                are edited, adapted, and forwarded.

            <p>The origin of the post, and so the question of the author, recedes
                into the background here; Resulting in «most users themselves having no

            <p>Hence, new attempts to restriction are often rigorously dismissed
                and, if at all, only bumpily established. In the recent past, copyright
                regulations on the Internet have, in the first place, been met with

            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-indent: 0px">It is important to note here that each country establishes its own
                copyright regulations - both within national borders as well as within
                the Internet as well.</p>
            <p>This text will refer to German law, unless stated otherwise.</p>
            <p>Jurists commonly distinguish between three offences in matters of
                copyright infringement. These include the commonly known acts of
                counterfeiting, plagiarizing<em>,</em> and bootlegging. Product piracy
                is a collective term that may refer to any of these offences.</p>
            <p>Differentiating between these three terminologies can be delicate,
                though generally agreed upon definitions go as follows: While
                counterfeits are deceptive forgeries, often of inferior quality, and
                plagiarisms refer to copies passed off as one's own creation, bootlegs
                are rather an unlawfully made or distributed copy of copyrighted
                material. Whereas an art forger copies a painting and makes it appear to
                be created by the original artist, the plagiarist passes off the copy as
                his own work.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 13</sup></a></p>

            </figure>
-->
            <p>The bootlegger here takes a more distanced position to the work. They
                rarely republish an item for personal acknowledgement and rather set
                themselves the goal of redistributing the work to a (local)
                community.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="mat/img/dark-side-of-the-moo.jpg">

            </figure>
            <p>Notably though, German copyright law does not include a so-called
                'legal definition' for these terms. They are rather colloquial,
                popular-juristic umbrella terms for verbs brought into association by
                the German dictionary such as '(to) forge, imitate, copy, borrow, adopt,
                fake and mimic'.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 14</sup></a> There are no divisive lines between
                the acts and rather serve as self-made categorizations to help
                navigating scenarios.</p>
            <p>When examining concrete legal guidelines for determining acts of
                'copyright infringement', things get cloudier. Per definition, a work is
                uncopyrightable (and therefore always free to copy) if it is not
                qualifiable as an 'intellectual creation', therefore being banal and
                lacking the individuality required for copyright protection (§ 2 II
                UrhG)<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 15</sup></a>.</p>
            <p>This means, concretely, that a subsequent author may not be
                prohibited from using commonplace words 'and', 'the', 'a', or even the
                letter 'm' or 'n'. What is essential is that the reference in question
                possesses enough 'distinctiveness' to be considered creative. Though—how
                many letters does it take to formulate something original?<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-marker fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup> More Info</sup></a></p>
            <p>A concrete formulation for the line between a banal creation and a
                work possessive of 'intellectual creation' does not exist; Ergo,
                copyright infringement, in its various forms of severity, does not
                necessarily violate applicable law and is much rather considered a grey
                area. Black and white 'yesses' and 'noes' are simply nonexistent here.
                The definitions for the terms, as well as judging the severity of
                infringement, will always be down to the evaluation of a judge and their
                interpretation in deciding the fate of a design piece.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 16</sup></a></p>

            <p class="subheadline">Exceptions in Internet «New Land»</p><br>
            <p style="text-indent: 0px">Evidently, even outside the Internet, copyright regulations,
                maintained for centuries, carefully ordered, and extensively formulated,
                continue to spark debate. These already shaky copyright laws of the
                offline world seep into the Internet and flow from the interpretable to
                the porous—As of yet, the Culture-Digital is being paired up and thrown
                together with copyright legislature dating back to times of Goethe and
                Beethoven.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 17</sup></a></p>
            <p>The German law has sought to create clarity in dealing with fair use
                in the so-called «new land»<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-marker fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup> More Info</sup></a> <a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 18</sup></a>
                that is the Internet in the same way it hopes to create clarity
                elsewhere, too: with a bounty of more and again more paragraphs and
                reformulations and legislations and a mass of bureaucratic acts.</p>
            <p>The recent <em>Act to adapt copyright law to the requirements of the
                    digital single market</em> outlines new dos and don'ts in 171 pages of
                finest legal prose: 15 seconds are allowed, 160 characters and 125
                kilobytes—except <em>this</em>, and only if <em>that</em>.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 19</sup></a> Oh, Germany, you bulging bulwark of
                exceptions and small print, neatly sorted and aligned—A shame, though,
                that hardly any of the users on the web seem to be taking any of it
                seriously - let alone seriously violating anything at all?</p>
            <p>In the first place, national copyright laws in the 'real world' have
                little effect in the borderless Internet and often slip off of a lack of
                international consensus. «A big question is always how the various
                national laws [on the Internet] are compatible with each other. What
                rights apply if the server is in country A, the user is in country B and
                the programmer is in country C? There are no rules there.»<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 20</sup></a></p>
            <p>This bundled unclarity, in harmony with an unprecedented ease of
                (re)production, likewise has an effect on the investigations, or rather
                the non-investigations, of rule-breakers. «Technological development has
                removed many barriers to the dissemination of cultural goods, so that
                any computer owner can now easily create things that, in the past, would
                have been possible only with significant investment. This impacts
                enforcement of law, as prohibition online is handled completely
                differently from that of traditional private use in the offline
                world.»<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 21</sup></a></p>
            <p>For even when there is a clear rule-breaking, prosecution is often
                too cumbersome and abundantly inefficient for prosecutors; rules and
                laws are only as good as their implementation, and it seems no one

            <p>An egalization of copyright values has taken on a life of its own on

            <p>Internet users form resistance to restrictions within the virtual
                space by exerting a form of collective casualness in breaking copyright
                rules, as if they were not there in the first place. «Classic copyright
                law and its comprehensive protective rights are based on the fiction of
                an originless creation. Creators have always stood on the shoulders of
                giants. But as long as borrowed ideas were only implied, ambiguous, and
                reformed in works, this fiction of an originless creation could be
                maintained.»<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 23</sup></a></p>

                confronting us with—the illusion has broken.</p>
            <p>«The definition of the computer was that of a machine, which can
                imitate all other machines. That definition should remove all

            <p>And so, an enormous breadth of anti-copyrighters, willful or
                unwilful, persists firmly in place; The Internet archives, public domain
                distributors and obscure torrenting platforms in fully stacked online
                piracy portals, representatives of anticapitalistic access to the
                content of the Internet, appearing in all possible legal and

                Internet’s early days, embraced by its presentday community with open
                arms. The online pirate's role does not correspond to the dirty
                reputation of a rogue that once preceded them anymore. Rather, they are

            <p class="subheadline">The Bootleg</p><br>
            <p style="text-indent: 0px">Enough already, with legalities.</p>
            <p>Judging the blurriness of legal terminology, this chapter will rather
                focus on users who have made themselves comfortable within the very grey
                area of copyright legislation itself—The Culture-Digital, the remixers,
                the <span class="definitionWord">Crackers</span>, <span class="definitionWord">Rippers</span>,
                <span class="definitionWord">Hackers</span>, counterfeiters, <span class="definitionWord">Yankee Thrifters</span>,
                bootleggers, <span class="definitionWord">Modders</span>, pirates and copy-artists of the
                times. Truly, when maneuvering the nitty grittys of law, action is often
                more determinative that fine print.
            </p>
            <p>Once a product is made public, its original, carefully curated design
                is at the mercy of whomever may get their hands on it.</p>
            <p>An original copy is not perfectly formed for everyone—in fact, it is
                perfectly formed for a vast minority of the consumer market, and the
                fact it is perfectly formed for that vast minority is because that vast
                minority does not consider the design of the non-perfectly formed
                object—if even anyone. It is supposedly perfectly formed for those
                deemed a 'target audience': With this notion comes bias. Perhaps
                <em>mechanically</em> perfectly produced, it is not
                <em>functionally</em> perfect for the consumer.
            </p>
            <p>When the original good, in its needed shape, size and functionality,
                does not exist, own technical ability is required to shape what
                <em>does</em> exist into something fitting your needs.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 27</sup></a>

            </figure>
            <p>What the Hacker aims to achieve is to adapt the premade item,
                available in countless iterations, identically perfect, to his own needs
                and likings. They do not abide to sheepish acceptance. Though the
                prevalent motif of the hacker has come to be associated with green text
                and monospace, it rather stems from the hijacking of everyday objects,
                hardware; most prevalently introduced by Nicolas Collins' <em>The Art of
                    Hardware Hacking</em><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 28</sup></a>. Items are taken out of their
                current functionality, broken open and analyzed for possible synthesis
                with work of their own. Thus, the hacker aims to introduce his own
                character and thinking into an innate object and adapt it to serve his
                own purposes.</p>
            <p>Through bootlegging, the consumer outside of the target audience does
                not settle for the initially given and mass-produced shape of the item
                but cuts away what they do not need and add on top what is necessary to
                get their job done. Quick and dirty solutions do the trick to
                reappropriate an object to serve its new purpose. The bootleg is a hack,
                a quick solution to a complex problem. The hacker takes building block
                that already exist and plugs them into each other. <a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 29</sup></a>
                The result is an item akin to <span class="definitionWord">Bricolage</span>,
                not quite the original, not quite something new—a hybrid.</p>

            <p>This individualized level of functionality does not exist in a world
                of copyrighting and nitpicking over when an item is distinct enough from
                a counterpart: Breathing space for adaptation goes out the window.</p>
            <p>What is perfect for some can hardly be perfect for millions of others
                also. Sometimes, what is perfect is a copy with a single modification.
                Sometimes, a handful of modifications, and sometimes, half of the
                original is ripped away and screwed on top of something else.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, this modification occurs in magnificent technical prowess
                and attention to detail, most of the times in a makeshift, DIY fashion,
                starkly contrasting the original design. Gaps in initial
                conceptualization are plugged with tape and plywood.</p>

            <p>These processes leave traces on the original objects, so called

                messily written name labelling a mass-produced item as one’s own, a
                sense of identity and individuality is added to the object.</p>
            <p>What is now present is a scratched-up version of a high-definition
                first, an «illicit fifth-generation bastard of an original»<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 32</sup></a>. Thus, the aesthetic
                reappropriation of the asset directly mimics the inherently

            <p>The bootlegger hacks into an object which is not meant to be opened.
                It's an answer to throw away culture. Lack of repairability, planned
                obsolescence. The bootleg does not try to hide what it is.</p>

            <p style="text-indent: 0px">Created around an original during production and retail is a mystical
                aura, proving the items legitimacy: It relies on the idea of a perfect,
                intentional, and curated state. The item carries an identity with it,
                thought out by the brand that published it, carefully constructed and
                maintained, apparent in its cleanest, purest form in the shelved item.
                Brands rely on this idea of the original massively. It is what justifies
                the power and authority over the counterfeit or any successors and gives
                legitimacy to the idea of copyright in the first place.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 33</sup></a></p>
            <p>It is this aura<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 34</sup></a>, broken apart and overwritten, that
                gives the bootleg, the altered version, its power. In the collection of
                one-and-only originals, the slightest inconsistency stands out.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 35</sup></a> The result is a molded-out canvas

            <p class="subheadline">Digital Bootlegging</p><br>
            <p style="text-indent: 0px">Bootlegging quickly grew beyond the act of a single individual,
                tinkering away, to a widespread network of the digital world. In the
                digital space, the bootleg is socialized. It no longer functions
                specifically for one or the other: Instead, it passes through networks
                and groups as filetypes, iterating in different versions, cached by one
                and processed by another. What establishes itself online is a sort of
                non-space underground distribution network of those to whom the
                circumstances of the original do not abide. They link together, edit to
                their needs and likings, sharing among others in similar situations.</p>
            <p>The functionality of torrenting methods used on virtually all
                pirating networks—the <em>libgens</em>, <em>z-libraries,
                    thepiratebays</em> and <em>ubuwebs</em>—visualise this. Rather than
                downloading files from a central server, users link together: When one
                downloads a file, they get connected to many others who have done so
                before them, each providing a small piece of the requested file. Once
                all parts are collected, the data is pieced together on the obtainer's
                computer—and the downloader ideally becomes a distributor themselves.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-marker fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup> More Info</sup></a> <a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 36</sup></a>

            </p>
            <p>Though inherently physical, the scars of labor reappear here again—In
                the form of smearing data compression in the digital.</p>
            <p>With each new copy, and redownload, and passing on, there is the
                potential for a small change to be saved into the file: Be it the
                reduction of video quality, as it becomes compressed and recompressed in
                many up-and re-downloads, or a streaming-host who cuts their username in
                front of an intercepted movie.</p>
            <p>These little quirks are glitches, uncharacteristic of the mechanical
                perfection are maintained in ever new split-offs of the original
                file.</p>
            <p>Similar to its physical counterpart, the digital bootleg becomes
                independent from its high-quality counterpiece. It is adapted and, as it
                is hacked, is torn apart and arranged back together elsewhere, by a
                different user, all leaving their marks of use behind as the original
                becomes overwritten (and overwritten and overwritten).</p><br><br><br>

            <span class="chapterHeadline nonlaw">!Internet Non-Law</span><br><br>
            <p style="text-indent: 0px">Paradoxically, those underground networks and string-pullers of the
                piracy portals are equally helping their opponents, the copyright
                representatives, with every act of disobedience. With their creative new
                solutions to find loopholes and undermine the system to keep theirs
                running, they simultaneously reveal the weak spots of legislature. The
                pirate exposes ways to circumvent the current regulations, allowing them
                to be identified and closed by the regulators—only for a new loophole to
                be found.</p>
            <p>The pirate's activities thus have a direct impact on making the
                copyright legislation more compact and more robust against future
                attacks of their own: «The hacker becomes a helper of that knowledge
                regime whose challenger they saw themself as. They oscillate between
                subversion and stabilization.»<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 38</sup></a></p>
            <p>But the resulting endless loop of judicial executions is tedious and
                sluggish, and so it remains a game of cat and mouse in which slow
                government processes are always two steps too late against the rapid
                technical adaptations of their opponents.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-marker fnref11" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup> More Info</sup></a>
                It is for this reason that many believe copyright laws are simply not

                always win.»<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 39</sup></a></p>
            <p>With the legal body of legislation failing to get a clear grip on
                fair use online, the responsibility of a verdict becomes much more
                dependent upon on which platform the infringement takes place and who is

            <p style="text-indent: 0px">What comes with fixing is care. Rather than throwing away an item
                that has served its purpose, one figures out its exact functionality,
                figures out the system it is built on, its uses, its components, and
                begins curating materials to compile and merge with the original.</p>
            <p>Within this mentality, things can further be adapted to one’s liking
                and specific needs, filled with personality. Its functionality is

            <p style="text-indent: 0px">A particular item that I have come across, with which I am attempting
                to exemplify this process, is the <em>Movie Viewer</em> produced by
                Fisher Price first in the 1970's and up until today. It is a radar-gun
                like object, loaded with visuals in the form of super 8 film. The user
                peeks into the hollow body of the toy through a viewfinder, right onto a
                strip of super 8 film, advanced by rotating a wheel on the viewer’s
                side. Frame by frame, a 40 second loop of Disney footage is played
                analogly right in your hands.</p>

            <p>At some point, intrigued engineers figured out how to pry the toy
                open carefully, replacing the default film with their own super 8
                strips, then putting it back together again. Individuals could now flip
                through their personally recorded footage, having individualized the
                toy<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 40</sup></a>.</p>
            <p>A sweet activity before Fisher Price discontinued the original and
                reissued an updated version years later, switching from accessible super
                8 film to a custom format. With this switch the gear advancing the film
                inside the toy did not match up with the holes in publicly available
                film anymore, rendering the movie viewer worthless for
                customization.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, within this working methodology, I see a thorough
                connection to valuable approaches of customizing present today. What had
                started as an activity of taking advantage of the functionalities of a
                preexisting item, now developed further into the space of coding.
                Reusing previously established, functional code as a vessel for personal
                projects is common practice; Almost all computer programs contain many
                ideas borrowed from elsewhere. Many also contain short sections of
                actual code copied and pasted—but for anyone to file a claim of
                plagiarism for reuse of code is practically unthinkable.</p>
            <p>I believe this approach can likewise be useful in determining an act
                of unethical copyright infringement outside of the digital. Basis for
                this lies on the fundamental practice of integrating the code into a
                system of one's own. Value stems from adapting the underlying system to
                one’s own needs and personal liking, changing what is necessary.</p>
            <p>Within coding and especially the open-source movement, there is a
                group of fixers, maintainers, and hackers that share the same values of
                adaptation and customization to established systems, stripped of all of
                their analogue qualities and passed on to the digital space.</p>
            <p>In open-source culture, these readaptations, overwritings and edits
                are in itself engrained in the functionality of the object, or much
                rather, the creation of it: the tool, the software. There is no original
                copy. Even if there were, no one would care. Programs are fully intended
                to be broken open, picked apart and edited to the liking of the
                individual that downloaded it to their computer. In total, an amass of
                slightly different copies of a program, perfectly in sync to the needs
                of each a one. What becomes much more decisive for differentiating
                between blatant plagiarism and functional copying is not the visual
                output, but the introduction and compilation of personal character.</p>
            <p>Reenter the movie viewer. Up until today, few people remain that
                scour the Internet for 1973 originals—they are sparse, crumbly and jam
                easily. In a quest this thesis has brought me upon, I aim fix the second
                version movie viewer and supply to necessary parts to my and the other
                movie viewer comrades' needs.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-marker fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup> More Info</sup></a></p>
            <p>It seems incredibly fitting that the answer to the problem of the
                unfitting gear itself may come from the open-source community. The idea
                is to digitally recreate and mechanically reproduce the first-generation
                gear through a 3D printer, bringing it back to life. In doing so, the
                non-fitting gear of the second edition can be replaced, and the
                customized movie viewer lives on.</p><br><br><br>


            <!--            CHAPTER TWO.THREE-->
            <span class="chapterHeadline reframing" style="text-indent: 0px">!Reframing Internet Copyright</span><br><br>
            <p style="text-indent: 0px">It has been established that, no matter if functional execution or
                artistic practice, ideas live on in further works, sometimes visible,
                sometimes hidden behind reappropriation and a fresh coat of paint,
                sometimes as a mere inspiration. The lines between copy and original are
                not black and white, but blurry greys, differing in intensities of
                modification and originality. In an increasingly digital world, remixing
                and readaptation has become a social phenomenon, causing existing
                regulations to crumble and be naturally disregarded: especially among
                younger generations.</p>
            <p>In a <em>Plea for a New Term of the Original</em>, Dirk von Gehlen
                proposes a solution to the situation—Instead of maintaining the current
                pseudo-black-and-white legislature, he suggests creating a scale that
                allows for more gradual attribution of originality: distinguishing
                between 'highly original' and 'lesser original' works. Here, clear
                distinctions would not be needed anymore. A space for leeway, a
                transparent communication of influence and homage could be laid out,
                evading the constant question of rule breaking—kissing the idea of
                'Yes!' and 'No!' and the 'masterful artistic creation' and the idea of
                originality entirely goodbye.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 41</sup></a></p>
            <p>«The idea of originality only exists because people [in law] decide
                whom possesses it. Originality is only created in the eye of the
                beholder. This legitimization is just as arbitrary as the rulings of
                copyright infringement themselves.»<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 42</sup></a></p>
            <p>The question of originality, here, would rather become one of flowing
                transition, transparently communicating the level of influence.</p>
            <p>Especially in dealing with generations that have been socialized on
                the Internet and have built their network culture on the basic methods
                of sharing and remixing, there must be adjustments. «A free society must
                provide its members with opportunities for sharing and participation—and
                that includes copying (and not only in the digital space). We would do
                better if we were to establish a system in which one would openly draw
                from the ideas of others, creating and copying references<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 43</sup></a>»
                instead of tiptoeing around legal sponginess. «Maybe that's where
                originality emerges; <em>within the variation of one's own copy»</em><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 44</sup></a>.</p>
            <p>Instead of clear distinctions, Gehlen borrows and idea from Anaïs
                Hostettler, supposing a line of thinking closer to the idea of
                'Versions', akin to those derived out of software development in the
                digital space und reminiscent of approaches in open-source culture. The
                act of copying, rather than being an inspiring act of reproduction, is
                pushed into an in itself inherently creative act of questioning existing
                material and refunctioning it. With proper copying comes critical
                reflection, questions of self-reliance and functionality, durability,
                communication, and expression of thought.</p>
            <p>Whether the exact moment of when a copy becomes independent can be
                found, who knows. Whether it matters, who cares. It seems many a problem
                of splitting hairs between blacks and whites could be evaded in a full
                embrace of grey.</p> <br><br><br><br>

                        checking intangible amounts of online material for copyright
                        infringements due to increasing popularity among advertising partners.
                        As a solution, they developed the content scanning algorithm
                        <em>Copy-ID</em>, which scans over 500 minutes of video every
                        second.

                        <p>The algorithm was quickly optimized with the rapid closure of many
                            loopholes that were uncovered, and illegitimate claims continue to
                            generate much discussion today. A flagged video results in a direct loss
                            of income from the creator, oftentimes appeals are burdensome. YouTube
                            has accepted the categorical loss of income from many of its users to

                    others, replugging and merging. Though it is today considered a predominantly digital
                    act of hacking websites and servers to access date, early hacks were much more analogue, involving toy cars and physical phone lines.

Ideally, the obtainer of the new file now becomes a distributer themselves. This technology allows users to circumvent regulated downloading platforms and makes the downloading of files communal and private.
