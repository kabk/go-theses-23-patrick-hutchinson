            <p>The 2000s. '<em>You wouldn't steal a car</em>', it quivers in rubber-pressed
                letters across the opening screen of the newly purchased DVD.</p>
            <p>Even before you enter the main menu, mixed in with film previews, the
                unskippable service announcement invokes, with its sinister backstreets,
                leather jackets and crowbars, a dire scenery of crime and
                internet-mischief. '<em>You wouldn't steal a car, a handbag, a
                    television,</em> it argues; likewise, you should keep your hands away
                from rotten download buttons looming on the internet.</p>
            <p>The video, charmingly over the top as it may be, remains to catch
                plenty of slack and harvests much amusement for its wild analogies<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>—rightly so, perhaps. The leap
                between a particularly serious case of theft and a comparatively milder
                copyright infringement likely came off a bit too daring (ambitious,
                rather?) for most a DVD watcher. So be it.</p>
            <p>Did the broadcasting creatives of the time produce the most
                compelling anti-piracy campaign possible?</p>
            <p>Probably not.</p>
            <p>Did the sequence nevertheless succeed in limiting piracy and taking a
                step towards safeguarding the content of media culture?<br />
                Again, not at all.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, there's even indication that the clip encouraged
                online piracy rather than repressing it.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p><br><br>

            <p><span class="chapterHeadline">!Introduction: <span class="definitionWord">Culture-Digital</span></span></p><br>
            <p>At the advert's time, the triumph of the computer had plunged our
                cultural world into full tour-de-force digitization. The complete
                makeover of our everyday life meant unprecedented developments in
                preservation, multiplication and dissemination of media assets of all
                kinds, virtually reduced down to three keyboard-strokes. No matter
                whether photo, video, or audio, the culture-digital is multimedia,
                encoded and compressed into the <em>.jpg's</em>, <em>.mp4's</em> or
                .<em>wav's</em> of our times.</p>
            <p>Getting hold of, and copying, online material of any medium has been
                dramatically simplified and what was once laborious and involved great
                production effort is now swiftly manageable by the amateur<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
            <p>In the midst of this technical reproduction spree, the question of
                implementing digital copyright law is, particularly inticing.</p>
            <p>The publication of the ad marked humble beginnings of attempted
                copyright implementation on the web, and, in its ridiculed reception,
                portraits the difficulties in establishing stately law in a space
                inherently unstately. It precisely marks the halfway point between today
                and the very beginnings of the Internet; then, an unorganized network to
                be shaped and structured by a string of evolving (Internetwork-)
                principles formulated by those specifically concerned with computer
                networking: programmers, computer scientists, hackers, geeks, and
                nerds.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
            <p>Since its inception, precisely this group made sure the roots of the
                Internetwork would lay in ideas of an unrestricted, anarchic space of
                concentrated availability and freedom. The "<em>Intergalactic Computer
                    Network</em>"<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, as it was called, should be space
                for unrestricted openness and collaboration, with core values notably
                voiced in a collection of pathbreaking quotes and guidelines, such as
                "Architecture is Politics"<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>, "Code is law"<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> and "The net interprets censorship
                as damage and routs around it."<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> The very architecture
                on which the World Wide Web would be built was in itself designed to
                allow for the free and unrestricted flow of information. There was
                sharing, copying, and no one thinking about copyright regulations. Much
                rather, computers were continuously developed onward in an underlying
                <span class="definitionWord">Open-Source</span> approach based on the sharing and
                reusing of established discoveries—early examples are the sharing of the
                source code that made the internet itself via
                <em>UUCP</em>, <em>Usenet</em>, <em>IRC</em>, and <em>Gopher</em>. It
                was simply convenient to allow for peer review and bug fixing, seeking
                collaboration in times of limited resources.

            <p>It seems these roots of unregulated freedom resonate especially
                within the generations that don't know any handling of cultural property
                outside of the existence of the internet to begin with. The underlying
                phenomena of the internet are rubbing off on an increasingly digital
                culture—the "culture digital". I must be influenced by these
                circumstances just as well.</p>
            <p>The internet, with its large-scale networking possibilities and
                interconnected reference systems of hyperlinks, brings with it a
                redistribution culture of sharing, retweeting, and reblogging. Social
                media platforms such as Twitter and the image/video-based Tik-Tok in
                particular, make the reposting and remixing of existing material,
                irrelevant if copyrighted or not, a core mechanism deeply anchored in
                the very existence of the platform. Through the reinterpretation of a
                previous post, trends are created, images multiply and develop new
                niches.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The culture digital is one of
                remixing. In consequence, "a large part of everyday remix practices is
                moving in direct contradiction to existing legal frameworks." Images and
                videos on film and culture practically become public domain<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>, are edited, adapted, and
                forwarded. [Image Reference]</p>
            <p>The origin of the post, the question of the author, recedes into the
                background here, resulting in "most users themselves having no interest
                in being considered as authors for their own works".<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
            <p>Hence, new attempts to restriction are often rigorously dismissed
                and, if at all, only bumpily established. In the recent past, copyright
                regulations on the Internet have, in the first place, been met with
                great headaches. <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p><br><br>

            <p><span class="chapterHeadline legalities">!Legalities</span></p><br>

            <p>It is important to note here that each country establishes its own
                copyright regulations - both within national borders as well as within
                the Internet as well.</p>
            <p>This text will refer to German law, unless stated otherwise.</p>
            <p>[Jurists] commonly distinguish between three offences in matters of
                copyright infringement. These include the commonly known acts of
                <em>counterfeiting</em>, <em>plagiarism</em> and <em>bootlegging</em>.
                Product piracy is a collective term that may refer to any of these
                offences.
            </p>
            <p>Differentiating between these three definitions can be delicate,
                though generally agreed upon definitions go as follows: While
                counterfeits are deceptive forgeries, often of inferior quality, and
                plagiarisms refer to copies passed off as one's own creation, bootlegs
                are rather an unlawfully made or distributed copy of copyrighted
                material. Whereas an art forger copies a painting and makes it appear to
                be created by the original artist, the plagiarist passes off the copy as
                his own work.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
            <p>The bootlegger here takes a more distanced position to the work. They
                rarely republish an item for personal acknowledgement and rather set
                themselves the goal of redistributing the work to their community.</p>
            <p>Notably though, German copyright law does not include a so-called
                "legal definition" for these terms. They are rather colloquial,
                popular-juristic umbrella terms for verbs brought into association by
                the German dictionary such as "(to) forge, imitate, copy, borrow, adopt,
                fake and mimic".<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> There are no divisive lines between
                the acts.</p>
            <p>[This footnote is only relevant for german translation]</p>
            <p>When examining concrete legal guidelines for determining acts of
                "copyright infringement", things get cloudier. Per definition, a work is
                uncopyrightable (and therefore always free to copy) if it is not
                qualifiable as an 'intellectual creation', therefore being banal and
                lacking the individuality required for copyright protection (§ 2 II
                UrhG)<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>.</p>
            <p>This means, concretely, that a subsequent author may not be
                prohibited from using commonplace words "and", "the", "a", or even the
                letter "m" or "n". What is essential, is that the reference in question
                possesses enough 'distinctiveness' to be considered creative. But—how
                many letters does it take to formulate something original?<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
            <p>A concrete formulation for the line between a banal creation and a
                work possessive of 'intellectual creation' does not exist; Ergo,
                copyright infringement, in its various forms of severity, does not
                necessarily violate applicable law and is much rather considered a grey

            <p>Thus, even outside the Internet, copyright regulations, maintained
                for centuries, carefully ordered, and extensively formulated, continue
                to spark debate.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> These already shaky copyright laws
                of the offline world seep into the internet and flow from the
                interpretable to the porous—As of yet, the culture digital is being
                matched and thrown together with copyright legislature dating back to
                times of Goethe and Beethoven.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
            <p>The German law has sought to create clarity in dealing with fair use
                in the so-called "new world"<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> that is the internet
                in the same way it hopes to create clarity everywhere else, too: with a
                bounty of more and again more paragraphs and reformulations and
                legislations and a mass of bureaucratic acts. The recent "Act to adapt
                copyright law to the requirements of the digital single market" outlines
                new dos and don'ts in 171 pages of finest legal prose: 15 seconds are
                allowed, 160 characters and 125 kilobytes—except <em>this</em>, and only
                if <em>that</em>. <a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
            <p>Oh, Germany, you bulging bulwark of exceptions and small print,
                neatly sorted and aligned—</p>
            <p>A shame, though, that hardly any of the users on the web seem to be
                taking any of it seriously - let alone seriously violating anything at
                all?</p>
            <p>In the first place, national copyright laws in the "real world" have
                little effect in the borderless internet and often slip off of a lack of
                international consensus. "A big question is always how the various
                national laws [on the Internet] are compatible with each other. What
                rights apply if the server is in country A, the user is in country B and
                the programmer is in country C? There are no rules there."<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
            <p>This bundled unclarity, in harmony with an unprecedented ease of
                (re)production, likewise has an effect on the investigations, or rather
                the non-investigations, of rule-breakers. «Technological development has
                removed many barriers to the dissemination of cultural goods, so that
                any computer owner can now easily create things that in the past would
                have been possible only with significant investment. The impact of
                behavior comparable to private use is thus completely different from
                that of traditional private use in the offline world.»<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
            <p>For even when there is a clear rule-breaking, prosecution is often
                too cumbersome and abundantly inefficient for prosecutors; rules and
                laws are only as good as their (implementation), and it seems no one
                [really wants] to indulge in the nitty-gritty of tedious prosecution
                processes<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>–for acts that are committed
                millions of times a day anyhow.</p>
            <p>Thus, an egalization of copyright value has taken on a life of its
                own on the Internet, allowed to roam free.</p>
            <p>Internet users form resistance to restrictions of the virtual space
                by exerting a form of collective casualness[naturalness?] in matters of
                copyright.</p>
            <p>"Classic copyright law and its comprehensive protective rights are
                based on the fiction of an originless creation. Creators have always
                stood on the shoulders of giants.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> <a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>
                But as long as borrowed ideas were only implied, ambiguous, and reformed
                in works, this fiction of an originless creation could be maintained."<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> Not so with the wave of remixing
                and reappropriating the internet is confronting us with—the illusion has
                broken.</p>
            <p>"The definition of the computer was that of a machine, which can
                imitate all other machines. That definition should remove all
                definitions of copyright and and intellectual property".<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>

                inspiration by others." <a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
            <p>And so, an enormous breadth of fully stacked online piracy portals
                persists firmly in place; The Internet archives, public domain
                distributors and obscure torrenting platforms, representatives of
                anticapitalistic access to the content of the Internet, appearing in all
                possible legal and not-so-legal shades of gray. Mostly they offer
                movies, but also books, and music and software and photos and videos and
                video games. So everything.</p>
            <p>They remain intact as remnants of the Internet’s early days, embraced
                by its [modern] community with open arms. The online pirate's role does
                not correspond to the dirty reputation of a rogue that once preceded
                them anymore. Rather, they are the everyday consumer.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

            <p>Chapter III.1 — Production of the Original</p>
            <p>Enough already, with legalities.</p>
            <p>Judging the blurriness of legal terminology, this chapter will rather
                focus on users who have made themselves comfortable within the very grey
                area of copyright legislation itself—The pirates, remixers, crackers,
                rippers, counterfeiters, bootleggers, modders and copy-artists. Truly,
                when figuring out legalities, action is often more determinative that
                fine print.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Disclaimer necessary?</p>
                <p>Discussing whether piracy is illicit behavior or a strive towards
                    open access is to meddle with questions of morality. Navigating this
                    topic is as tiptoeing around a pit of snakes, eager to be avoided.
                    Ultimately, it will be down to background and perspective. Here, I am
                    sharing mine and what I have gathered.</p>
                <p>Additionally, it seems much of the discouragement in copying stems
                    from a negative connotation of those who practice it. Pirates, Hackers,
                    Rippers... I suggest dropping this negative connotation for a few
                    minutes.</p>
                <p>[Here, the "Hacking Everyday Life" chapter could fit nicely.]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Once a product is made public, its original, carefully curated design
                is at the mercy of whomever may get their hands on it: It enters a
                second life of disintegration, reappropriation, adapting, fixing,
                modifying, and dubbing.</p>
            <p>An original copy is not perfectly formed for everyone—if fact, it is
                perfectly formed for a vast minority of the consumer market, and the
                fact it is perfectly formed for that vast minority is because the vast
                majority does not consider the design of the non-perfectly formed
                object—if even anyone. It is supposedly perfectly formed for those
                deemed a "target audience": With this notion comes bias. Perhaps
                <em>mechanically</em> perfectly produced, it is not
                <em>functionally</em> perfect for the consumer.
            </p>
            <p>When the original good, in its needed shape, size and functionality,
                does not exist, own technical ability is needed to shape what does exist
                into something to fitting your needs.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
            <p>Through bootlegging, the consumer outside of the target audience does
                not settle for the initially given and mass-produced shape of the item
                but cuts away what they do not need and add on top what is necessary to
                get their job done.</p>
            <p>This individualized level of functionality does not exist in a world
                of copyright and the myth of an unadaptable item. What is perfect for
                some can hardly be perfect for millions of others also. Sometimes, what
                is perfect is a copy with a single modification. Sometimes, a handful of
                modifications, and sometimes, half of the original is ripped away and
                screwed to something else. The result is an item akin to bricolage<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>, not quite the original, not quite
                something new—a hybrid.</p>
            <p>[Image Examples here]</p>
            <p>Examples: Yankee Thrift, Samizdat Producers, Guerrilla gardeners,
                Phreakers and Open-Sourcers, Movie Pirates and The Post Folk
                Archive.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, this modification occurs in magnificent technical prowess
                and attention to detail, most of the times in a makeshift, DIY fashion,
                starkly contrasting the original design. Quick and dirty solutions do
                the trick to reappropriate an object to serve its new purpose. The
                bootleg is a hack, a quick solution to a complex problem. The hacker
                takes building block that already exist and plugs them into each other.
                It is akin to tinkering and craftsmanship. <a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>
                Gaps in initial conceptualization are plugged with tape and plywood.
                These processes leave traces on the original objects, so called "scars
                of labor"<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> , evidence of consumption and
                interference. They are craft fixes, "The glue drips, screw holes, cum
                stains and fingerprints"<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> left on an immaculate
                original. Proof that the original object has been taken and used. The
                principle of copying and modifying serves as a method of perfecting</p>
            <p>What is now present is a [dirty, scratched up] version of a
                high-definition original, an "illicit fifth-generation bastard of an
                original image"<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>. Like a messily written name
                labelling a mass-produced item as one’s own, it adds a sense of identity
                and individuality to the object.</p>
            <p>Thus, the aesthetic reappropriation of the asset directly mimics the
                inherently counter-capitalist act of stealing it in the first place. <a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
            <p>It must be noted to some that these aesthetics and reappropriations
                are high art. Examples are Tom Sachs, Marcel Duchamp, Andy Warhol.</p>
            <p>Created around an original during production and retail is a mystical
                aura, proving the items legitimacy: It relies on the idea of a perfect,
                original, and intended state. The item carries an identity with it,
                constructed of the brand that published it, carefully constructed and
                maintained, apparent in its cleanest, purest form in the shelved item.
                Brands and artists rely on this idea of the original massively. It is
                what justifies the power and authority over the counterfeit or any
                successors and gives legitimacy to the idea of copyright in the first
                place.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
            <p>It is this aura<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> , broken apart and overwritten,
                that gives the bootleg, the altered version, its power in the first
                place. In the collection of one-and-only originals, the slightest
                inconsistency stands out. The result is a molded-out canvas of
                mechanical perfection, taped over, scribbled onto, cut apart reglued
                together. It adheres precisely to the needs of a one and functions to
                their needs. <a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
            <p>In other words: "Apple could never make anything as shitty as the

            <p>Chapter III.3 — [Contemporary] Bootlegging</p>
            <p>Bootlegging quickly grew beyond the act of a single tinkering
                individual to a widespread network of the digital world.</p>
            <p>In the digital space, the bootleg is socialized. It no longer
                functions specifically for one or the other: Instead, it passes through
                networks and groups as filetypes, iterating in different versions,
                cached by one and processed by another. What establishes itself online
                is a sort of non-space underground distribution network of those to whom
                the circumstances of the original do not abide. They link together, edit
                to their needs and likings, sharing among others in similar
                situations.</p>
            <p>The functionality of torrenting methods used on virtually all
                pirating networks— <em>thepiratebays</em>, <em>libgens</em>,
                <em>z-libraries</em> [SEIZED] and <em>ubuwebs</em>— <em>visualise</em>
                this. Rather than downloading files from a central server, users much
                rather link together. When one downloads a file, they are connected to
                many others, each providing a small piece of the requested file. Once
                all parts are collected, the data is pieced together on the downloader's
                computer — and the downloader ideally becomes a distributor
                themselves.

            <p>Though inherently physical, the scars of labor reappear here again—
                In the form of smearing data compression in the digital.</p>
            <p>With each new copy, and redownload, and passing on, there is the
                potential for a small change to be saved into the file: Be it the
                reduction of video quality, as it becomes compressed and recompressed in
                many up-and re-downloads,<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> or a streaming-host
                who cuts their username in front of an intercepted movie. [IMG REF]</p>
            <p>These little [amateurish] quirks, (glitches) uncharacteristic for the
                mechanical perfection are maintained in ever new split-offs of the
                original file.</p>
            <p>Similar to its physical counterpart, the digital bootleg becomes
                independent from its high-quality counterpiece. It is adapted and, as it
                is hacked, is torn apart, and arranged back together elsewhere, by a
                different user, all leaving their marks of use behind as the original
                becomes overwritten (and overwritten and overwritten).</p><br><br>

            <p>Paradoxically, those underground networks and string-pullers of the
                piracy portals are equally helping their opponents, the copyright
                representatives, with every act of disobedience. With their creative new
                solutions to find loopholes and undermine the system to keep theirs
                running, they simultaneously reveal the weak spots of legislature. The
                pirate exposes ways to circumvent the current regulations, allowing them
                to be identified and closed by the regulators—only for a new loophole to
                be found.</p>
            <p>The pirate's activities thus have a direct impact on making the
                copyright legislation more compact and more robust against future
                attacks of their own.</p>

            <p>But the resulting endless loop of judicial executions is tedious and
                sluggish, and so it remains a game of cat and mouse in which slow
                government processes are always two steps too late against the rapid
                technical adaptations of their opponents.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
            <p>It is for this reason that [many believe] copyright laws are simply
